    "Suppose we have two molecule (graph) sorting algorithm as at certain RMG development point, one is `sortAtoms` the other is `sortVertices`. They will give two different sorting results.\n",

    "- Molecule atoms sorted by two algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "- Adjlists for the same molecule would be different because of different sorting results\n",
    "\n",
    "- Mapping between reactant and reaction family template reactant would be different\n",
    "\n",
    "- From the post `How RMG generates templates?` the mapping order matters for the final kinetics choice, so kinetics would be different although reactions are still same\n",
    "\n",
    "- Give different kinetic simulation results\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently `master` doesn't have two different sorting algorithm, so the divergence won't be caused by this situation. But since there was one point when `master` has both, the divergence is observable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lesson learned**: always using the same sorting algorithm for `matchReactantToTemplate` or at least if you have to have two sorting algorithms, don't give both the right of changing `sortingLabel` (otherwise, one sorting algorithm can deactivate the other since sorting is implemented based on `sortingLabel`)"
